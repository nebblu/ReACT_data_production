# Nonlinear Boost Emulator for Modified Gravity and Dark Scattering Models

This package contains the data production pipeline and [Cosmopower](https://alessiospuriomancini.github.io/cosmopower/) emulation files required to create a nonlinear boost emulator specifically tailored for:

* **f(R) gravity**
* **Dark Scattering model**

The nonlinear boost is defined as:

$B(k, z) = R(k, z) \times \frac{P_{\text{pseudo}}(k, z)}{P_{\text{LCDM}}(k, z)}$

Both power spectra, $P_{\text{pseudo}}$ and $P_{\text{LCDM}}$, are computed using **[HMCode2020](https://github.com/alexander-mead/HMcode)** without baryonic feedback. The halo model reaction $R(k,z)$ is calculated using **[ReACT](https://github.com/nebblu/ACTio-ReACTio)**.

## Directory Structure

* `pipe_cosmopower_parallel`: Main data production pipeline directory.

* `codes`: Folder containing Boltzmann Solver and HMCode2020

* `cosmopower`: Folder containing files needed to train the emulator once boosts are produced. 

## Other relevant files 

* `pipe_cosmopower_parallel/parameters.dat`: Configuration file specifying:

  * Directories for your Boltzmann Solver, ReACT, and HMCode2020.
  * k-range and number of wave modes sampled logarithmically within the range.

* `pipe_cosmopower_parallel/params/cosmo.txt`: Contains the cosmological parameter sets to be sampled. Typically, around **400k cosmologies** are needed for adequate sampling, though the exact number is model and prior-dependent.

* `cosmopower/create_params.py`: Script to generate `cosmo.txt` using a Latin Hypercube sampling strategy.

## Running the Pipeline

The main execution script is:

```bash
pipe_cosmopower_parallel/run_cp_x.sh
```

This bash script:

* Calls the Boltzmann Solver (e.g., MGCAMB or CLASS), ReACT, and HMCode2020.
* Uses template files found in `pipe_cosmopower_parallel/templates`.
* Outputs boost files into the `data/` directory, labeled as `boost{I}.dat`.

You can try to run 

> ./run_cp_x.sh 1 1 1 1 

to run the first cosmology in the cosmo.txt file in the log in node as a test. 

## Dependencies

### HMCode2020 Installation

* Locate the source file provided in `codes`.
* Copy this file into your HMCode2020 source directory (`HMCode2020/src`).
* Install HMCode2020 following standard procedures. This modified file allows specifying specific redshifts directly via terminal commands.

### Boltzmann Solver Installation

* Install either **MGCAMB** or **CLASS** in the `codes` directory.

## Post-processing and Training

* **Post-processing scripts** located in `cosmopower/` convert the raw `boost{I}.dat` files into `.npz` files suitable for emulator training.
* Training script (`training_boost_x.py`) is available in the `cosmopower/` directory to train your nonlinear boost emulator using processed data.

## Cluster Submission

Batch scripts compatible with **SLURM** are included, facilitating easy submission and management of large-scale jobs on computational clusters.
